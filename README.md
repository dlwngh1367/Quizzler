# Quizzler

This app is a simple quiz game.
If the user selects the correct answer in the view, the view box is displayed in green and the score increases in the upper left corner, and if the wrong answer is selected, the box turns red and the score does not increase.
This game includes quizzes about the developer myself, Juho, and quizzes on various topics such as world history and mathematics.
To develop this app, I created a collection of quizzes using Structure, the core of Swift, and used MVC design patterns, which are really important in mobile development.
The Question class of the model serves as the structure of the basic questionnaire, and the QuizBrain class forms the structure of the quiz, and includes various methods, which are responsible for logic and calculation.
The View Controller class, a controller, acts as a link between the model and the view and interacts.
